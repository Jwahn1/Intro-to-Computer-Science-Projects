I have implemented the remainder calculator by taking both inputs from the two <input> tags and labeling them x and y and taking the result so I may change
the value of the <p id="result-message"> to give back the result. After this was done I reused the two input tags and added the disabled attribute.
For the reset function I change the value of the disabled attribute to be false and then change the value of both input tags to be empty strings as well as the <p> tag
to be an empty string.
